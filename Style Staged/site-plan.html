    <h3>Theme</h3>
    <p>Ocean</p>
    <p>We chose the theme of the ocean because it is a calming and beautiful place that many people enjoy. The colors we chose are inspired by the different shades of blue and turquoise found in the ocean, as well as the white of the waves and foam. We wanted to create a website that is visually appealing and easy to navigate, while also evoking a sense of tranquility and relaxation.</p>
    <p>Our group plans to implement an ocean theme in our webpage entirely through SCSS/CSS
      by using colors, gradients, shapes, and animations instead of images. We will start with
      a background gradient in shades of blue and teal to represent the depth of the ocean,
      creating a layered effect that gives a sense of dimension. To mimic waves, we plan to use CSS
      shapes and pseudo-elements with subtle animations that make them move gently across the page.
      We also want to add small decorative details, such as floating bubbles or fish, using CSS
      circles, animated to rise or drift, which will enhance the underwater feel. Rounded,
      flowing fonts will complement the design, giving the text a soft, fluid appearance that
      matches the ocean theme. By combining these techniques, our group aims to create a cohesive,
      visually engaging ocean atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/palette/03045e-0077b6-00b4d8-90e0ef-caf0f8"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/palette/03045e-0077b6-00b4d8-90e0ef-caf0f8</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">[#caf0f8]</td> <!--white?-->

    <h3>Typography - Subject to Change</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: Luckiest Guy Static
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Roboto Condensed
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
       The HTML for this page was created to be semantic, accessible, and free of nearly all
          other opinions. Nested sectioning elements with the class `.container` serve as additional style aids since you do not have access to alter the base HTML. IDs are included where needed for nav anchors or accessibility, and a small number of additional classes are provided for key elements without IDs. Don't forget the `.skip-link`!
